# Registripe: SilverStripe Event Management Module
The event management module allows you to manage event details and registrations from within the CMS.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/registripe/registripe-core.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/registripe/registripe-core)

## Features

*   Allow people to register, view their registration details and un-register
    for events.
*   Attach multiple ticket types to each event. Each ticket can have its own
    price, go on sale in different time ranges and have different quantities
    available.
*   Require email confirmation for confirming free event registrations, or
    canceling a registration.
*   Send registered users a notification email when event details change.

## Configuration

When working with multiple attendees, you can carry over specific fields from the previous attendee. Here is an example configuration:
```yaml
EventAttendee:
  prepopulated_fields:
    - Organisation
```

If you extend the available EventAttendee db fields, you can define which ones are required by default in the add/edit form:
```yaml
EventAttendee:
  required_fields:
    - FirstName
    - Surname
    - Email
    - OrganisationID
    - Gender
```
Note that the TicketID will always be required.

## Requirements
*   SilverStripe 3.1+
*   [Omnipay](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-omnipay) module for collecting payments with registration.
